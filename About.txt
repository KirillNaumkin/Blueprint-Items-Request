HOW IT WORKS
• When you take blueprint (or book with active blueprint) in your cursor, mod buttons appear in the top GUI - now you can quickly request as many items as many times you want to build the blueprint.
• Input multiplier if needed (1 by default).
• Click "=" or "+" button.
• Wait until your robots bring requested items.
Note: If you input not a number or number below 1 - the value becomes equal to 1. If it's not an integer - it will be rounded down.

KNOWN ISSUES
• If inventory is opened, request slots will not be visually updated (reopening does visual update), see https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=31696#p199826
